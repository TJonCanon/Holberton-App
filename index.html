		<div class="about-me__body">
			<p>I am Taylor Joyner. My friends call me TJ. I am 28 years old from Tulsa, OK. My interest include photography, gaming and consuming media of all different types. I quite enjoy a long a walk and a podcast. I am excited to be applying to the Holberton School as I have had an affinity for technology from a very young age.I was always the one called on in the family to troubleshoot any problem pertaining to tech. I was always tinkering with the family computer from a young age. To be able to bring these skills into a practical use helping solve real world problems would be a dream come true.

		<h2 class="section__title section__title--why-me">What Makes Me a Good Fit?</h2>
		<div class="why-i-fit">
			<p> I am a self starter, excited absorb all the knowledge Holberton has to offer. Working with technology is already second hand nature for me. I feel like I would pick up things quickly. The prospect of learning as a team is intriguing. This model seems to mirror what real world experience would look like. I would contribute well to this model as I have always worked exceptionally well with others. I I am fully prepared for the challenges ahead and look forward to taking them on with an open mind while maintaining a positive attitude throughout. I am appreciative of the opportunity to apply. </p>
